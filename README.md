# Advent of Code Solutions

Welcome to my Advent of Code solutions repository! In this repository, I'll be sharing my Python solutions for some of the Advent of Code challenges from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2020).

## What is Advent of Code?

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.
